ABOUT
=====

This repository contains the settings and tweaks to standard emacs to make it more generalized and its shortcuts more conformant to the existing software paradigms, without compromosing on its core ethics. It has all the bells and whistles that a modern IDE or editor has plus the advantage of it being emacs itself.
